This is a calorie and macro calculator. It has options to show your remaining calories/macros. It also has the option to add food you have eaten which will subtract from the remaining counts. There are some hardcoded foods that you can add that are based off of 100g, the application will ask the user for how many grams of the food they ate and will do the necessary calculations to have correct values. You can also create recipes by manually inputing the name and values for calories and macros. Once saved, it will upload it to a csv file named recipes. These recipes will be loaded upon application launch which will allow them to persist between closes and launches of the app. You can then select these recipes as things you have eaten and it will subtract the values from your remaining counts as well.
